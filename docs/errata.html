<h1> Spec Errata and enhancements </h1>

The following is an <b>Unofficial</b> change list for Jain-sip-1.2.
They were discovered too late to be incorporated into the current release
or were unearthed as a result of use.

<ul>
<li><b><it>javax.sip.message.SipRequest.clone() </it> -- clarify behavior </b>
<br/>
The message contents are cloned as follows:
<ul>
<li> If the content is of type byte[] a new byte[] array is allocated and
the original contents are copied over to the cloned request. 
<li> If the content is of type String then a new String equal to the old
String is allocated and assigned to the cloned request.
<li> If the content is of type Object and it  has a public 
clone method then it is invoked and the resultant Object is used in the new
cloned SipRequest.
</ul>

<li><b><it>javax.sip.MessageFactory.createSipRequest(String )</it> 
- clarify behavior </b> <br/>
If the argument is null then an empty SipRequest is created. </li>

<li><b><it>javax.sip.MessageFactory.createSipResponse(String )</it> </b>
Creates and parses a Sip Response from a string. This is useful for
applications such as protocol test tools that may need to create responses
independent of requests </li>


<li><b><it>javax.sip.Dialog.sendAck </it> -- clarify behavior </b>  <br/>
Note that it is used is used for sending both ACK and PRACK messages. 
</li>

<li><b><it>javax.sip.message.Message.getUnrecognizedHeaders - clarify behavior </it><br/> </b>
Gets a ListIterator over all the UnrecognizedHeaders in this Message. Note
the order of the UnrecognizedHeaders in the ListIterator is the same as
order in which they appeared in the SIP Message. UnrecognizedHeaders are
headers that the underlying implementation does not recognize.  If the
message is missing a required header (From, To, Call-ID, CSeq, Via)
the entire message willl be dropped by the underlying implementation and
the header will not be included in the list. Headers that are part of the
supported set of headers but are not properly formatted will  be included
in this list. Note that Headers that are not part of the supported set of
headers are retrieved as Extension Headers. These must have a name:value
format else they will be rejected by the underling implementation and
included in this list. A Proxy should not delete UnrecognizedHeaders and
should add these Headers to the end of the header list of the Message
that is being forwarded. A User Agent may display these unrecognized
headers to the user.  </li>

<li><b><it>javax.sip.Transaction.getDialog </it>  - clarify behavior<br/> </b>
If the transaction is associated with an existing Dialog or could result
in a Dialog being created in the future (ie. the stack is configured
to recognize the method as a Dialog creating method or is one of the
natively supported dialog creating methods such as INVITE, SUBSCRIBE or
NOTIFY), then the implementation must either associate the transaction
with the existing Dialog or create a Dialog with null state. However,
if the Transaction is neither dialog creating nor can be associated with
an existing dialog, then the implementation must return null when the
application issues getDialog on the transaction.  
</li>

<li><b><it>RequestEvent and ResponseEvent </it>  -- new Method <br/> </b>
The RequestEvent and ResponseEvent will support a new method <br/>
<it> Dialog getDialog ( ) </it>
</li>

<li><b><it>javax.sip.header.HeaderFactory.createToHeader </it> --
null tag. <br/>
</b>
Document that Null is accepted for the tag value.
</li>

<li><b>Enhance the dialog package to allow for dialog free operation of the
stack </b><br/>

The stack will support a new optional configuration parameter: <br/>
<it>
javax.sip.AUTOMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT  =  [ true | false ] <br/>
</it>

<b>The default will be true.  </b>
If set to true, the stack will behave as it currently does. 

<it>if javax.sip.AUTOMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT  = true </it> <br/>

This is summarized here:

<ul>
<li>
A dialog will ge created on a Dialog - creating  transaction.
</li>
<li>
The first 2xx response to the transaction will drive the dialog to the 
CONFIRMED state.
</li>

<li>
Additional 2xx responses to the transaction will be acked automatically if 
the RETRANSMISSION_FILTER is enabled.
</li>

<li>
Additional 2xx responses to the transaction will be presented to 
the application with a null transaction id if  
RETRANSMISSION_FILTER is disabled.
</li>

</ul>

The default behavior  represents a common use case and will allow the
construction of simple user agents with ease ( which is the common use
case for JAIN-SIP). This is how the dialog support currently works.
The following new behavior will be added when the following configuration
parameter is set.

<p><it>javax.sip.AUTOMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT =  false </it><br/>
This is motivated by the following use cases:
<ul>
<li>
Dialog free servers (such as proxy servers) that do not 
want to pay the overhead of the dialog layer.
</li>
<li>
UACs that may want to create multiple Dialogs for a single Invite (as
a result of forking by proxy servers).
</li>
</ul>


<p>The application is responsible to create the Dialog if it wishes to do so. 
The application may Create a Dialog and associate it with a response when a 
response (provisional or final)  of a dialog-creating  request.

The provider will support the following new methods:
<br/>

<it>
Dialog getNewServerDialog (Response)  throws DialogAlreadyExistsException <br/>

Dialog getNewClientDialog (Response) throws DialogAlreadyExistsException
</it> 

<p>


<p>Here is a fragment of code that indicates how UACs may use this support:


<pre>
try {
   if ( responseEvent.getDialog() == null ) {
        clientDialog = sipProvider.getNewClientDialog();
   } else {
       clientDialog = responseEvent.getDialog();
   }
} catch ( DialogAlreadyExistsException ex ) {
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
</pre>
<br/>
As this is intended primarily for proxy servers, RETRANSMISSION_FILTER
will be automatically disabled when AUTOMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT is set to
off. If AUTMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT = off then RETRANSMISSION_FILTER = off;
Additionally, the Provider will allow applications to create new 
ServerTransaction for any request (not just dialog creating requests) 
when AUTOMATIC_DIALOG_SUPPORT = off 
</li>

<li> <b> Add a new method getDialog() to Request/Response Events </b> <br/>
See code fragmement above for use case </li>

<li><b>Add SipTransaction set/getApplicationData() </b> <br/>
This allows an application to associate an un-interpreted object with
a Transaction and retrieve it for later use.
Applications that manage their own dialog layer may use this feature 
to associate application context with Transactions.
</li>
 
<li><b>The stack needs to support only one Provider -- not a provider for
each transport </b> <br/> The IP address and port of the stack is known when 
sending outbound messages thus the documentation will note that there
will be a single provider instance. This implicitly assumes that the
server will use the same transport for sending responses as the outbound
request.
</li>

<li><b>Add support for multi-homed hosts -- allow the IP address to be
specified as part of the listening point </b> 

Use case:

In a multi-homed host, we may want to create a different dialogs each with its
own IP address and port.

Add a method <br/>
<it>
ListeningPoit createListeningPoint(String ipAddress, int port, StringTransport)
</it>
<br/>
To the javax.sip.SipStack interface. When this method is called, the
listening point will be created with the specified IP address and the
default IP address of the stack is ignored.
The original (current) method that does not specify the ip address as a 
parameter will use the default address of the stack.
</li>

<li><b>Add support for a Network Layer</b> <br/> Some classes of
Applications need access to the sockets that are used by the stack to
send out messages. For example the STUN stack needs to be able to access
this. To support the requirements of such extensions, a new optional
configuration parameter will be supported and a socket factory network
layer will be supported.

<p>
To support this behavior. An application may implement an interface: <br/>
<it>
javax.sip.NetworkLayer
</it>

And <b> optionally </b> register it as a property when the stack is created
The reserved property name for registering an implementation of this 
interface will be <br/>

</it>
javax.sip.NETWORK_LAYER
</lit>

</li>

<li>
<b>Add a SipListener method to support asynchronous reporting of IO Exceptions
</b><br/>
Asynchronous IO Exceptions may occur as a result of errors during 
retransmission of requests.
The Transaction state machines are required to report IO Exceptions to the 
Listener immediately (according to RFC 3261). The current design only supports
delayed reporting through timeouts. A new Listener SipListener2 that supports
a processIOException method will be defined. A new Event IOExceptionEvent
will be defined.
</li>


</ul>
