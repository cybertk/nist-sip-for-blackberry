<h1> <i><font color="blue">  NIST-SIP 1.2 -- SIP Libraries and Tools for
the People!</font></i></h1>
 


<blockquote> 
 <h2> <u>What's in this Distribution?</u></h2>
 This distribution contains JAVA(TM) libraries for the following:
  <ul>
 <li> The official Reference Implementation of the JAIN SIP API (JSR 32) maintenance
release. </li>
  <li>The Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for the maintenance release of JSR 32.
  <li>An implementation of the JAIN SDP API (JSR 141). </li>
 
  </ul>
    <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ehgs/sip/papers.html" target="_blank">The Session 
Initiation Protocol (RFC 3261) </a> is a text based signaling protocol that
is widely used for IP Telephony, Instant Messaging and and Internet Conferencing
applications.   
  <p>The Session Description Protocol ( RFC 2327 ) is used for describing 
media sessions and is frequently used in conjunction with SIP. </p>
  
  <p>Primarily, this distribution contains <a href="./api/index.html" target="_blank">a protocol
stack/library that will help you build  and test SIP applications and servers.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h3> <u>Core Library and Stack Packages</u> </h3>
 This&nbsp; packages included in the gov.nist.javax.sip hierarchy form the
 reference implementation for JAIN-SIP 1.1   <a
 href="http://www.jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr032/" target="_blank"> 
JSR-32 maintenance release.</a> JAIN-SIP is a low level protocol API for
SIP.    
<h3> <u>Technology Compatibility Kit </u> </h3>
The source code for the technology compatibility kit is provided in
the directory test/tck.  
<h3> <u>Examples </u> </h3>
These include the following pure JAIN applications:  
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://jain-sip-presence-proxy.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">  A public domain proxy and registrar with presence and Instant messaging support. </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://jain-sip-presence-proxy.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">  A public domain Instant Messaging user agent which inter-operates with Microsoft  Messenger
</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://sip-communicator.dev.java.net/" target="_blank"> A video Soft phone that uses the Java Media Framework 
</a> 
</li>
</ul>
   
  <h3> <u>Tools </u> </h3>
  <a href="tools/tracesviewer/README.html" target="_blank"> A trace viewer application that
 can be used to view the traces generated by the NIST Stack 
</a>  This is  our primary debugging tool. To report stack problems please
send us a debug log which can be input to the trace viewer to determine the
problem.
  <h2> <u>How to build it </u></h2>
  
  <h3> <u> Supported Platforms </u> </h3>
 The specification states that JAIN-SIP-1.1 needs J2SE 1.4.x If your
platform will support it, download
and install  <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">J2SDK 1.4.2 </a> or above.
It is highly recommended that you use J2SDK 1.42 or above it as it is much faster than J2SDK 1.3.1.  
<font color="blue"> However, you can
also build <b>NIST-SIP</b> under  JDK 1.3.1 
(for use on a Compaq IPAQ class machine, for
example). NIST-SIP-1.2 compiles and runs on  the Ipaq using the
Blackdown jvm (1.3  compatible) running on top of Familiar (Linux
embedded operating system). To add Swing support,  you just need to
install an optional library.  
</font> 
 
<h3> <u> Building it from Scratch </u> </h3>

 Get the source from CVS or the nightly snapshot. CVS is recommended. 
 Visit <a href="http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/"> the
 stable repository on java.net </a> and follow the instructions there to
 get the source code. The preferred build tool is GNU make but you can also
 use Jakarta Ant if you wish.  
 <p> To use make under Windows (XP, 2000 or NT) please install Cygwin from <a
 href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank"> Redhat (http://www.cygwin.com). </a>  and
make sure that you include the build package and bash when you install it).
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank"> First, get and install J2SE 
(click on the java logo on the right). 
<img src="get_java_red_button.gif"/> 
</a>
</li> <br/>
Use the makefile provided to build everything: 
  <ul>
 <li> edit build-config - adjust the paths to libraries and J2SDK and
the xerces and junit libraries. 
Get the xerces and junit libraries and install them in the directories
libs/junit and libs/xerces respectively.  These are available from the
junit.org website and apache websites. Else,
<a href="http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/libs.zip"> 
 you can download a (possibly out of date) copy of these from NIST  </a> 
and unzip them at the root of the distribution tree 
(which will create a libs directory for you).
 </li>
 <li> The following make targets are relevant: 
      <ul>
 <li> <font color="blue"> make ri </font> makes just the reference  implementation
for JAIN-SIP.  A jar file nist-sip-1.2.jar will be generated which is the
RI for JAIN-SIP 1.1. </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> make javadoc </font> makes the documentation 
        </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> make tools </font> makes the tools </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> make examples </font> makes the examples. 
        </li>
        <li> <font color="blue"> make classfiles </font> makes just  the
.classes (no docs). </li>
      </ul>
 </li>
 
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
To build the TCK, please follow the instructions above and generate
the classes for the RI (ie. use the classfiles target).  You
need to get and install the junit library  in lib/junit to build the TCK. 
It may be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.junit.org/" target="_blank">the junit.org web site </a>.  Here is how you
can build the TCK:

<ul>
<li> make the RI using the instructions above. </li>
<li> make the TCK using the target "tck". All the classes needed for
the tck are included in jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar. </li>
<li> You can run the TCK in text or GUI (interactive) mode.
In GUI mode, run the tck against the test implementation using the following
command (assuming the class path includes the implementation under test): <br/>
<it> <font color=blue> java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -mode gui </font> </it> 
<br/>
A user interface appears and allows you to enter the implementation path.<br/>
Alternatively, in text mode: <br/>
<it> <font color = blue> java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -mode text [-path impl_path] </font> </it> 
<br/>
Where impl_path is the path to your implementation (eg. gov.nist)
<li>
<it><font color=blue> java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -help </font>
</it> for more details on command line options. 
</li>
</ul>


</li>
</ul>

<h2><u> Reporting Bugs </u> </h2>
  <font color="red"> To report bugs you need to enable debugging and 
message logging.  
Set the gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL property to 32 to
enable debugging (see documentation for gov.nist.javax.SipStackImpl.java). 
Set the gov.nist.javax.sip.DEBUG_LOG property to  a writeable file name
(eg. debuglog.txt).
</font>  
Send us the generated debug log file to help us determine the problem. 
Post an issue to the bug tracker at the
<a href="http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">jain-sip project at java.net </a>
so we can better track bugs, and  email us at
<a href="mailto:nist-sip-dev@antd.nist.gov">nist-sip-dev@antd.nist.gov</a>
to notify us.
Note that you need to join the project on java.net as an observer to 
post an issue. Follow the instructions on the java.net website above 
to do this.

<h2><u>Release Status</u> </h2>
 JSR 32 is in the "maintenance" phase although essentially, this is a complete
re-write of the spec.  
<p/><font color=green> JAIN-SIP 1.1 is now declared "final".
This means that the API is frozen and the RI and TCK meet the approval 
of the JCP PMO. 
</font>
<a href="errata.html"> See here for an unofficial list of changes for the next release of this spec. </a>

<h2><u>Support </u> </h2>
</font>
<p> </p>
<font color="red"> As in much open of source software, 
the NIST-SIP is (and will remain) user supported and user tested code. 
Before you incorporate this into any product, please note that 
NIST provides no guarantee of continuing support.
You should regard this as experimental code. 
</font>

   
<p> 
However, take heart - the good news is that RI is stable and has 
been successfully deployed in several academic and commercial projects.  
The parser passes the SIPPING torture tests. 
It has been downloaded thousands of times and there is an active 
and supportive news group. 
Further, although this code is officially unsupported, 
we will try to keep up with your bug reports (and suggested fixes).  
You are part and parcel of this development effort
and NIST-SIP is only as good as the bug reports, 
feature requests and usage feedback reports you send in.   <br>
</p>
   
 <h2><u> Acknowledgments </u> </h2>
Many people have contributed bug reports and suggestions.
Where ever
applicable, we have tried to retain acknowledgment of contributions in the
code.  We have compiled <a href="../www/README.html">list of contributors.
