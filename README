JAIN-SIP 1.1 Reference Implementation
--------------------------------------
CONTENTS
-------
See docs/index.html

BUILD Notes
-----------
Platforms:
---------
You need to install J2SDK 1.3 or above. 1.41 is highly recommended. You can
get J2SDK from http://www.javasoft.com

Nist-sip1.2 compiles and runs on Ipaq using the Blackdown jvm (1.3
compatible) running on top of Familiar (Linux embedded operating
system). To add Swing support,  you just need to install an optional
library. 


Building It from Scratch
-------------------------
The distribution is pre-built but should you feel inclined to make changes,
or run the examples, you may wish to rebuild everything.

Using the makefile: 

1. edit build-config
2. make all

Building the TCK
----------------
The tck needs junit.jar
1. Build the RI as above.
2. make tck (builds a jar file containing the TCK).
3. to run the TCK 

java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -mode gui

Brings up a GUI and allows you to enter the path to your implementation.

Using Jakarta ant (get it from the apache web site).

You can the provided build.xml file.
We use make as the build tool of choice. 
build.xml is not always up to date.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the examples

Please ensure that the directory  classes  (relative to where you have
built the distribution) is included in the  classpath.  Makefile targets
and shell scripts  are provided in each example directory to run the
examples.

How to get Source Code Refreshes
--------------------------------

CVS Snapshot
------------

For those who cannot access CVS thanks to draconian or paranoid 
administrative policies, here is a HTTP url where a nightly source 
only snapshot is grabbed from the stable CVS repository and dumped:

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.tar.gz 

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.zip 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Access
----------

The "stable" cvs reposiotory is located on java.net. To download from CVS
(higly recommended), visit 

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/

And follow the instructions there. 
Note that you need to be logged in to java.net in order to acces the source 
from cvs.

COPYRIGHT
---------
The software was developed by employees of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Federal Government.
Pursuant to title 15 Untied States Code Section 105, works of NIST
employees are not subject to copyright protection in the United States
and are considered to be in the public domain.  As a result, a formal
license is not needed to use the software.

The NIST-SIP software is provided by NIST as a service and is expressly
provided "AS IS."  NIST MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED
OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT
AND DATA ACCURACY.  NIST does not warrant or make any representations
regarding the use of the software or the results thereof, including but
not limited to the correctness, accuracy, reliability or usefulness of

Permission to use this software is contingent upon your acceptance
of the terms of this agreement and upon your providing appropriate
acknowledgments of NIST's ownership of the software. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ranganathan's layman interpretation of the preceeding blather
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is public domain code. Do whatever you want with this software.
That means you can incorporate it into any product you wish or use it
as-is free of any royalty payments or license agreements.  You may even
drop it on your foot. However, you may not sue us (that includes me)
even if it has bugs and does not work as advertised.  You may not sue us (
that includes me) even if you drop it on your foot and it hurts your toe.
So be afraid. Be very afraid, because I am afraid.

NIST (ie. the public - including you and I but neither you nor I) owns
this software.  You may not grab ownership and get in the way of its
free distribution even if you invest a lot of effort into fixing it.
This is despite the fact that as it is in the public domain, you already
own it. Note that this follows from a simple application of reason -
once you own something, you own something and you may not own it again.
The software will remain in the public domain for now and ever more
(ie. until the sun shall shine and stars shall twinkle in the sky)
regardless of your use of it. Please be nice and acknowledge our efforts
if you find this code to be of use.

Corollary 1:
------------

Do not ask me for permission to use this code. I cannot permit you to use
that which I do not own.


Corollary 2:
-----------

Do not offer to pay me for the use of this code. I have absolutely no
interest in making money by selling something I do not own, not withstanding
my recent sale of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Corollary 3:
------------
Do not ask me for permission to own this code. I cannot grant you ownership
for something you, I and everybody else already owns.

i.e. Once you had it you had it. You cannot have it again. Owning is believing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ranganathan's totally paranoid interpretation of the above:

visit 

http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr032/index2.html

and agree to the licensing terms above before using the javax.sip API
or you will be hounded by lawyers.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The javax.sdp code is included here for evaluation purposes only.
You may examine it but you may not touch it because it does not like to
be handled.

Visit the jsr 141 page and read the licensing terms for yourself.

http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=141

The implementation of the 

javax.sdp code gov.nist.javax.sdp.* is in

the public domain.

The licensing terms for the API are mysteriously in an "expired" state
and the JSR 141 expert group mailing list is a favorite target for
spamming attacks.


------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have read every word of this so  far you deserve a medal.
Such is the logic of the non-legal mind. Note that non-legal minds
are not necessarily illegal minds and legal minds are also frequently
illegal minds.  Also note that a mind is a terrible thing to lose ... or
not to have.

Nuff said! have fun with it. 

Ranga.
