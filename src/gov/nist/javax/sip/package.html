This is the root of the JAIN implementation of SIP. Contains utility
classes and implementatin of the provider and stack. Implementation of the
headers is contained in header and implementation of the parser in the
parser subdirectory. The stack contains the implementation classes for
the stack. The StackImpl here implements the Jain SIP stack. The dialog
and transaction implementations reside in the stack package. 

Additional Features (that are not required by the JAIN-SIP spec) and that
can be enabled by properties specified when the SipStack is created:

<ul>
<li> Message Logging features - permits the application to log messages in
a format that are suitable for trace viewing using the trace viewer facility.  
</li>
<li> Load Control Features - Control the transaction table size and server 
conurrency to lessen Denial of Service attacks.
</li>
</ul>

In addition to the standard configuration Parameters supported by
JAIN-SIP, the stack supports the following configuration Parameters :

<ul>
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL = integer </b><br/>
 Currently only 16 and 32 is meaningful. 
 If this is set to 16 or above, then incoming
 valid messages are  logged in SERVER_LOG. If you set this to 32 and 
 specify a DEBUG_LOG then vast amounts of trace information will be dumped
 in to the specified DEBUG_LOG.  The server log accumulates the signaling
 trace. 
 <a href="{@docRoot}/tools/tracesviewer/tracesviewer.html">
 This can be viewed using the trace viewer tool .</a>
 Please send us both the server log and debug log 
  when reporting non-obvious problems.</li>
 
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.SERVER_LOG = fileName </b><br/>
  Log valid incoming messages here. If this is left null AND the 
  TRACE_LEVEL is above 16 then the messages are printed to stdout.
  Otherwise messages are logged in a format that can later be viewed
  using the trace viewer application which is located in 
  the tools/tracesviewer directory. 
 <font color=red> Mail this to us with bug reports.  </font>
  </li>
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.LOG_MESSAGE_CONTENT = true|false </b><br/>
  Set true if you want to capture content into the log. Default is false.
  Setting to true is bad idea if you are using SIP to push a lot of bytes through TCP.
 </li>
     
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.BAD_MESSAGE_LOG = fileName </b><br/>
   Messages that do not contain the required headers are dropped.
   This file indicates where the bad (unprocessable) messages go. 
   Default is null (bad messages are not logged in their own file). </li>
 
     
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.DEBUG_LOG = fileName </b><br/>
   Where the debug log goes. 
 	<font color=red> Mail this to us with bug reports.  </font>
 </li>
 
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE = integer</b> <br/>
  Maximum size of content that a TCP connection can read. Must be
  at least 4K. Default is "infinity" -- ie. no limit.
  This is to prevent DOS attacks launched by writing to a
  TCP connection until the server chokes.
 </li>
 
 
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.MAX_SERVER_TRANSACTIONS = integer</b> <br/>
    Max number of open SERVER transactions in the transaction table - incoming
   Requests that have the capability to create ServerTransactions will
   not be processed if server transaction table exceeds this size
   (default value is "infinity"). </li>
 
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.CACHE_SERVER_CONNECTIONS = [true|false] </b> <br/>
   Default value is <b>true</b>. Setting this to false makes the Stack close the server socket after
   a Server Transaction goes to the TERMINATED state. This allows a server to protectect against 
   TCP based Denial of Service attacks launched by clients (ie. initiate hundreds of client gransactions).
   If false (default action), the stack will keep the socket open so as to maximize performance at 
   the expense of Thread and memory resources - leaving itself open to DOS attacks.  However,
   if your client uses TCP to get through NAT boxes, you may want to set this to <b>true</b>
   so as to allow inbound signaling to the client.
 </li>
 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.STUN_SERVER = ipaddress[:port] </b> <br/>
	Stun server address:port. Default is null (no stun support). To enable
	this feature, download and install the stun4j package from stun4j.dev.java.net 
	and make sure stun4j.jar is in your class path.
</li>

 <li><b>gov.nist.javax.sip.CACHE_CLIENT_CONNECTIONS = [true|false] </b> <br/>
   Default value is <b>true</b>. Setting this to false makes the Stack close the server socket after
   a Client Transaction goes to the TERMINATED state. This allows a client release any buffers
   threads and socket connections associated with a client transaction after the transaction has
   terminated at the expense of performance.
 </li>
 
 <li> <b>gov.nist.javax.sip.THREAD_POOL_SIZE = integer </b> <br/>
   Concurrency control for number of simultaneous active threads for
   processing incoming UDP messages. 
  </li>
 
 <li> <b>gov.nist.javax.sip.MAX_CONNECTIONS = integer </b> <br/>
    Max number of simultaneous incoming TCP connections handled by stack. 
 </li>

 <li> <b>gov.nist.javax.sip.REENTRANT_LISTENER = true|false </b> <br/>
   Default is false. Set to true if the listener is re-entrant. 
  If the listener is re-entrant then the stack manages a thread pool
  and synchronously calls the listener from the same thread which read the
  message. Multiple transactions may concurrently receive messages and
  this will result in multiple threads being active in the listener at
  the same time. The listener has to be written with this in mind.
  </li>

 <li> <b>gov.nist.javax.sip.READ_TIMEOUT = integer </b> <br/>
  This is relevant for incoming TCP connections to prevent starvation at
  the server.
  This defines the timeout in miliseconds between successive reads after the 
  first byte of a SIP message is read by the stack. All the sip headers
  must be delivered in this interval and each successive buffer of the
  message content  must be delivered in this interval or the connection 
  will be killed and the message truncated.
  Default value is -1  (ie. the stack is wide open to starvation attacks) and
  the client can be as slow as it wants to be. Min value if specified should
  exceed 100 millisec.
  </li>
 </ul>

JAIN SIP 1.1 is not backward compatible with JAIN-SIP 1.0. Here is a summary
of the differences between JAIN-SIP 1.0 and JAIN SIP 1.1
