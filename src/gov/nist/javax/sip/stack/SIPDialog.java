/**
 * Tracks dialogs. A dialog is a peer to peer association of communicating SIP
 * entities. For INVITE transactions, a Dialog is created when a success message
 * is received (i.e. a response that has a To tag). The SIP Protocol stores
 * enough state in the message structure to extract a dialog identifier that can
 * be used to retrieve this structure from the SipStack.
