/**
 * Content encoding part of a content encoding header list.
 * @see ContentEncodingList
 *<pre>
 * From HTTP RFC 2616
 *14.11 Content-Encoding
 *
 *   The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
 *   media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content
 *   codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding
 *   mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type
 *   referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
 *   primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing
 *   the identity of its underlying media type.
 *
 *       Content-Encoding  = "Content-Encoding" ":" 1#content-coding
 *
 *   Content codings are defined in section 3.5. An example of its use is
 *
 *       Content-Encoding: gzip
 *
 *   The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by
 *   the Request-URI. Typically, the entity-body is stored with this
 *   encoding and is only decoded before rendering or analogous usage.
 *   However, a non-transparent proxy MAY modify the content-coding if the
 *   new coding is known to be acceptable to the recipient, unless the
 *   "no-transform" cache-control directive is present in the message.
 *
 *   If the content-coding of an entity is not "identity", then the
 *   response MUST include a Content-Encoding entity-header (section
 *   14.11) that lists the non-identity content-coding(s) used.
 *
 *   If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not
 *   acceptable to the origin server, the server SHOULD respond with a
 *   status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).
 *
 *   If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the content
 *   codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were applied.
 *   Additional information about the encoding parameters MAY be provided
 *   by other entity-header fields not defined by this specification.
