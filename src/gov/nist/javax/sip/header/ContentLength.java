/**
* ContentLength SIPHeader (of which there can be only one in a SIPMessage).
*<pre>
*Fielding, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 119]
*RFC 2616                        HTTP/1.1                       June 1999
*
*
*      14.13 Content-Length
*
*   The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the
*   entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or,
*   in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that
*   would have been sent had the request been a GET.
*
*       Content-Length    = "Content-Length" ":" 1*DIGIT
*
*   An example is
*
*       Content-Length: 3495
*
*   Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of
*   the message-body, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section
*   4.4.
*
*   Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.
*   Section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body
*   if a Content-Length is not given.
*
*   Note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from
*   the corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an optional field
*   used within the "message/external-body" content-type. In HTTP, it
*   SHOULD be sent whenever the message's length can be determined prior
*   to being transferred, unless this is prohibited by the rules in
*   section 4.4.
* </pre>
