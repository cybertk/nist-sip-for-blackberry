/**
 * Implements all the support classes that are necessary for the nist-sip

 * the JAIN abstractions. (i.e. It is the glue code that ties
 * the NIST-SIP event model and the JAIN-SIP event model together.
 * When a SIP Request or SIP Response is read from the corresponding
 * messageChannel, the NIST-SIP stack calls the SIPStackMessageFactory 
 * implementation that has been registered with it to process the request.)
