/**
 * An adapter class from the JAIN implementation objects to the NIST-SIP stack.
 * The primary purpose of this class is to do early rejection of bad messages
 * and deliver meaningful messages to the transaction layer. This is the class
 * that is instantiated by the NistSipMessageFactory to create a new
 * SIPServerRequest or SIPServerResponse. Note that this is not part of the
 * JAIN-SIP spec (it does not implement a JAIN-SIP interface). This is part of
 * the glue that ties together the NIST-SIP stack and event model with the
 * JAIN-SIP stack. Implementors of JAIN services need not concern themselves
 * with this class.
