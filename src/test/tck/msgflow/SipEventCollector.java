/**
 * <p>This class collects a single event from a given provider. The collector
 * listens for incoming events until the desired
 * event has been received, all following events are ignored.
 * After extractCollectedEvent method has been
 * called, the SipEventCollecter removes itself as a listener from the provider
 * and goes back  to its original state (i.e. could be reused).
 * The collector ignores all events except the one it is
 * supposed to collect. If an extract operation is a attempted on an event
 * other than the collected event a TckInternalError is thrown.
 * All exceptions raised within the collector are let to pass through
 * and are responsibility of the using class</p>
 *
 * <p>This class does not test event dispatching! Event dispatching tests
 * should have been performed before using this class in order to assure
 * coherent test reports.</p>
