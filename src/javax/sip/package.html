  <!-- ========== START OF NAVBAR ========== -->          
<p> This package contains the main interfaces that model the JAIN SIP architectute 
  from both an application developer and a stack vendor view.</p>
         
<ul>
       <li>Application Developer View:<br>
     The application developer is concerned with implementing the <a
 href="file:///D:/Protocols/SIP/v1_1/working/PackageDocs/SipListener.html">SipListener</a> 
  interface. This Interface defines 				the methods required by applications 
  to receive and process messages from a vendors SIP stack. <href
 ="SipEvent.html">A SipProvider receives messages from the underlying SIP 
  network, which in turn encapsulates these messages as Events and passes 
them  to its registered SipListener.</href> An application must register with
a  SipProvider to listen for Events by implementing the SipListener interface.
A single SipListener interface is mandated in the JAIN SIP architecture.<br>
         <br>
       </li>
       <li>Stack Vendors View:<br>
     The stack vendor implements all the interfaces in the JAIN SIP specification 
  excluding the SIPListener interface, however the two most important interfaces 
  from the architecture point of view are the <a href="SipStack.html">SipStack</a> 
  and the <a href="SipProvider.html">SipProvider</a> interfaces.</li>
                   
  <ul>
         <li>                                        
      <p> 				SipStack - This interface can be viewed as the management interface
  of the JAIN SIP architecture and as such only one may exist per IP address.
  The SipStack interface encapsulates the dynamic management characteristics
  of the SIP stack, such as ListeningPoints which encapsulate port
and   transport. As well as the central 				point for the creation and querying
  of SipProviders in the architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
         </li>
         <li>                                        
      <p> 				SipProvider - This interface can be viewed as the messaging
  interface of the JAIN SIP architecture. Multiple SipProviders are allowed
  within the architecture. This interface defines 				the methods that allow
  an application implementing the SipListener to register with the SipProvider
  to recieve incoming requests and responses. The methods defined &nbsp;to
 send SIP messages are also defined within the SipProvider<href
 ="message/Message.html"> interface.              </href><br>
                 </p>
      </li>
       
  </ul>
     
</ul>
        <b>Messaging model:</b><br>
The JAIN SIP architecture specifies that outgoing messages are sent via the
SipProvider and can either be of type <a href="message/Request.html">Request
</a>or <a href="message/Response.html">Response</a>. This action is initiated
by the application. Incoming messages
on the other hand are passed to an application registered to the SipProvider
and can either be of type <a href="RequestEvent.html">RequestEvent </a>or
<a href="ResponseEvent.html">ResponseEvent</a>, each containing a Request
or Response message respectively. This architecture follows the Listener/Provider event
model, which is suitable for applications that are unsure when the next event will arrive i.e. the applications listens for it. <br>
