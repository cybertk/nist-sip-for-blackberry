<h2>This document specifies the JAIN<sup><font face="Symbol"><font size="-2">TM
</font></font></sup> SIP API Specification v1.1.</h2>    

<h2>Objective<br>
    </h2>
     
<p>The objective of this specification is to develop a standard interface
  to the&nbsp; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that can be used independently 
 or by higher level programming entities and environments. This specification 
 was designed to provide a developer with a standardized interface for SIP
  services which are functionally compatible with the RFC3261 specification.
   This specification is a general purpose transaction based Java interface 
 to the SIP protocol. It is rich both semantically and in definition to the 
 SIP protocol. <br>
   </p>
     
<h2>Design approach </h2>
     
<p>JAIN SIP supports RFC 3261 functionality and the following SIP extensions; 
 the INFO method (RFC 2976), Reliability of provisional responses (RFC 3262), 
 Event Notification Framework (RFC 3265), the UPDATE method (RFC 3311), the 
 Reason Header (RFC 3326), the Message method (RFC 3428) defined for instant 
 messaging and the REFER method (RFC 3515). </p>
     
<p>JAIN SIP standardizes the interface to the generic transactional model 
 defined by the SIP protocol, providing access to dialog functionality from 
 the transaction interface. The architecture is developed for the J2SE environment 
 therefore is event based utilizing the Listener/Provider event model. The 
 specification is asynchronous in nature using transactional identifiers to
 correlate messages. It defines various factory classes for creating Request 
 and Response messages and SIP headers.&nbsp; JAIN SIP defines an interface 
 for each Header supported, which can be added to Request or Response messages 
 respectively. These messages are passed to the SipProvider with a transaction 
 to be sent onto the network, while the SipListener listens for incoming Events
 that encapsulate messages that may be responses to initiated dialogs or
new  incoming dialogs.</p>
     
<p>JAIN SIP is extensible by design. It defines a generic extension header 
 interface that can be used by applications that utilize headers that are 
not supported directly by JAIN SIP. The design also defines a mechanism to 
support future dialog creation methods in a JAIN SIP environment via the use
of Java Properties. JAIN SIP can be managed statically with regards to IP
addresses and router function, and dynamically specific to ports and transports.&nbsp;</p>
     
<p>The default handling of message retransmissions in JAIN SIP is dependent 
 on the application. Stateful proxy applications need not be concerned with 
 retransmissions as these are handled by JAIN SIP. Typically User Agent applications 
 must handle retransmissions of ACK&#8217;s and 2xx Responses, however JAIN SIP 
provides a convenience function that ensures all retransmissions are handled 
by the JAIN SIP implementation, reducing the complexity for applications acting
as user agents. This function may also be useful if JAIN SIP is used as a
base implementation for a SIP Servlet container or an EJB implementation.<br>
   </p>

<p> The specification leads would like to acknowledge effort and contributions 
 to the JAIN SIP specification from 8x8, dynamicsoft, Open Cloud, Nortel Networks 
and Siemens AG. Special thanks is also given to the development team at the NIST 
this specification owes alot to their commitment in developing the Reference 
Implementation and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) and to Emil Ivov from 
Louis Pasteur University, France also who helped develop the Technology 
Compatibility Kit in partnership with NIST.</p>
