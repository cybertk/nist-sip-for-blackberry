/**
 * The SipFactory is a singleton class which applications can use a single
 * access point to obtain proprietary implementations of this specification.
 * As the SipFactory is a singleton class there will only ever be one instance of
 * the SipFactory. The single instance of the SipFactory can be obtained using 
 * the {@link SipFactory#getInstance()} method. If an instance of the SipFactory 
 * already exists it will be returned to the application, otherwise a new 
 * instance will be created.
 * A peer implementation object can be obtained from the SipFactory by invoking 
 * the appropriate create method on the SipFactory e.g. to create a peer 
 * SipStack, an application would invoke the 
 * {@link SipFactory#createSipStack(Properties)} method.
 * <p>
 * <b>Naming Convention</b><br>
 * Note that the SipFactory utilises a naming convention defined by this
 * specification to identify the location of proprietary objects that
 * implement this specification. The naming convention is defined
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <b>upper-level package structure</b> referred to by the SipFactory
 * with the attribute <var>pathname</var> can be used to differentiate between
 * proprietary implementations from different SIP stack vendors. The
 * <var>pathname</var> used by each SIP vendor <B>must be</B> the domain name
 * assigned to that vendor in reverse order. For example, the pathname used by
 * Sun Microsystem's would be <code>com.sun</code>.
 * <li>The <b>lower-level package structure and classname</b> of a peer object 
 * is also mandated by this specification. The lowel-level
 * package must be identical to the package structure defined by this
 * specification and the classname is mandated to the interface name
 * appended with the <code>Impl</code> post-fix. For example, the lower-level
 * package structure and classname of a proprietary implementation of the
 * <code>javax.sip.SipStack</code> interface <B>must</B> be
 * <code>javax.sip.SipStackImpl</code>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Using this naming convention the SipFactory can locate a vendor's
 * implementation of this specification without requiring an application to
 * supply a user defined string to each create method in the SipFactory. Instead 
 * an application merely needs to identify the vendors SIP implementation it 
 * would like to use by setting the pathname of that vendors implementation.
 * <p>
 * It follows that a proprietary implementation of a peer object of this 
 * specification can be located at: <p>
 * <code>'pathname'.'lower-level package structure and classname'.</code><p>
 * For example an application can use the SipFactory to instantiate a Sun
 * Microsystems's peer SipStack object by setting the pathname to
 * <code>com.sun</code> and calling the createSipStack method. The SipFactory
 * would return a new instance of the SipStack object at the following
 * location: <code>com.sun.javax.sip.SipStackImpl.java</code>
 * Because the space of domain names is managed, this scheme ensures that
 * collisions between two different vendor's implementations will not happen.
 * For example: a different vendor with a domain name 'foo.com' would have
 * their peer SipStack object located at <code>com.foo.javax.sip.SipStackImpl.java</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Default Namespace:</b><br>
 * This specification defines a default namespace for the SipFactory, this 
 * namespace is the location of the Reference Implementation. The default namespace is
 * <code>gov.nist</code> the author of the Reference Implementation, therefore
 * the <var>pathname</var> will have the initial value of <code>gov.nist</code>
 * for a new instance of the SipFactory. An application must set the
 * <var>pathname</var> of the SipFactory on retrieval of a new instance of the
 * factory in order to use a different vendors SIP stack from that of the Reference
 * Implementation. An application can not mix different vendor's peer implementation
 * objects.
